\chapter*{Abstract} % Abstract name

The \osmvt{} project provides free, global and regularly updated vector tiles that can be used by anyone offline or on their own server to create
state of the art maps. The vector tiles are prerendered and can be used completely offline providing new possibilities for web and mobile developers. \\

This bachelor thesis improves upon \osmvt{} and adds support for prerendering the entire world, keeping the vector tiles up to date and improve quality significantly to become the best possible vector tile source from \osm{}. \\  

An open workflow keeping the vector tiles up to date with the millions of changes \osm{} contributors add every day has been created and can be scaled across multiple hosts to produce vector tiles with global coverage.
Due to the compatibility with Mapbox Streets it is possible for developers to switch their vector tile source
to their own tile server avoiding vendor lock in and bringing down costs. \\

Since the  vector tiles are available as download it is possible to create an offline version of OpenStreetMap for Desktop and Mobile. This will provide new possibilities for mobile developers that want to create applications that need a local map.\\
